#summary Serial communication between the Raspberry Pi and a host computer

= Introduction =

To debug what is happening on the Raspberry Pi we need a way to get contents of variables and hints of where the program is to be logged. The easiest way to do this is getting some kind of serial communication working.


= Details =

Via gpio the Raspberry Pi provides and mini uart via gpio pin 14 (tx) and gpio pin 15 (rx). Note: make sure you use 3.5v ftdi cable. Normal usb -> serial use a to high voltage (5v) for the Raspberry Pi.

The startup of this example has changed to use 'new' kernel style so it now actualy loads and start at $8000.

Like with the led example we first need to enable pin 14 (tx) (for now we ignore recieving data)
